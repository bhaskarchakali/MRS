1. What will this Web app do (Objectives)?
As the name suggests, it recommends movies based on different kinds of filtering techniques.
Users can get the recommendations of the movies which are popular or the movies which are related to some other movie.
The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch.

Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find something they like.
The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch.

3. The project consists of following parts:
Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Building - Machine Learning (Jupyter Notebook)
Web App - Streamlit
Deployment - AWS EC2


4. Project Workflow
This project is basically an implementation of Movie Recommender System using different filtering techniques used in machine learning.
Different pages in the app are using different filtering techniques based on which user get the resultant movie recommendations.
User can get a list of movies as an output when go on popularity based recommender system page where movies diplayed according to user id.
User can get movie recommendations based on content based filtering technique by providing a movie as input or selecting it from the drop-down menu.
User can get movie recommendations based on collaborative based filtering technique by providing a movie as input or selecting it from the drop-down menu and set the rating using range parameter.
